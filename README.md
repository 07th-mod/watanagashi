#### For Higurashi No Naku Koro Ni - Chapter 2 Watanagashi

> This repository **only** hosts the script files and a few voice files needed to fix bugs, check our [wiki](https://07th-mod.com/wiki/Higurashi/Higurashi-Getting-started) for instructions on how to install the patch!

This patch aims to combine the efforts of the ps3 voice patch and the ps3 sprites/background patch, and fill in missing voice files not covered by the original voice patch.

# Known issues

> In wata_002.txt, the scene where they are playing a game is missing a large chunk of dialog. Most likely because of obvious copyright issues. Needs retranslation to fit with the PS3 audio.

> In wata_tips_01.txt, [lines 474~526](https://github.com/higurashi-mod/watanagashi/blob/master/Update/wata_tips_01.txt#L474-L526) are clearly different from the PS3 version. Probably because of the whole red light talk. PS3 files for this scene are S20/05/440500017 and S20/04/440400025.

> In wata_004.txt, the PS3 script differs a lot from the PC version. There are dozens of new dialog lines, including voiced ones. Some voices are also missing and some lines were rewritten. This will most likely bother you if you play with japanese text.

> In wata_005.txt, the scene in Angel Mort was almost completely edited in the PS3 version. Some lines won't have voices and the flow of text/voice might get weird because of that. Later scenes in this chapters were also substantially increased in the PS3 version, this content might be translated and added later.

>In wata_010.txt, [line 241](https://github.com/higurashi-mod/watanagashi/blob/master/Update/wata_010.txt#L241) the dialogue said in the text and the voice file diverge. In the original text, Keiichi only asks confirmation about the hour (3:00). In the sound file, he adds "昨日に続いてか？" asking about the day before.

> Some voiced lines might end early if you are a slow header or playing with auto mode. There are too many cases of split lines (PS3 and PC version share the same script, but the reading is different) to fix manually. Some extreme cases may be fixed if you take your time to open an Issue.
